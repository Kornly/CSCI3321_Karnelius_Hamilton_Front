        <h2>Chicken Alfredo</h2>
       <p>Classic and easy to make, this version of Alfredo doesn't use flour to thicken the sauce. Instead, it relies on a slight simmer and a heavy dose of cheese</p>

            <li>12 ounces fettuccine</li>
            <li>Olive oil, for tossing</li>
            <li>12 ounces boneless, skinless chicken breast (about 2) </li>
            <li>1 stick (8 tablespoons) unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 cups heavy cream</li>
            <li>2 pinches freshly grated nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups freshly grated Parmigiano-Reggiano 
</li>

         <h2>Directions</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt generously. Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until al dente (tender but still slightly firm). Drain and toss with a splash of oil.      
</p>
        <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Meanwhile, slice the chicken into 1/4-inch-thick strips, and lay them on a plate or a sheet of waxed paper. Season with salt and pepper.      
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add 2 tablespoons of the butter. When the butter melts, raise the heat to medium-high and add the chicken in 1 layer. Cook, without moving the pieces, until the underside has browned, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip the pieces, and cook until browned and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer the chicken to a medium bowl.       
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Reduce the heat to medium. Add the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. Scrape the bottom of the skillet with a wooden spoon to release any browned bits. When the butter has mostly melted, whisk in the cream and nutmeg and bring to a simmer, then cook for 2 minutes. Lower the heat to keep the sauce just warm.      
</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Whisk the Parmigiano-Reggiano into the sauce. Add the chicken and cooked pasta and toss well. Season with salt and pepper. Serve hot in heated bowls.
